Bot: An advanced auto-clicker with various automation features.

Loader (NiggerLoader): A secure application loader that verifies a license key before downloading and running the bot.

Both applications are precompiled into executables (.exe), so no installation is required.

Features & Usage

Set Up Automation

The bot includes several automation features that can be configured to suit your needs:

Auto Clicker  : Automates mouse clicking with customizable click intervals, burst clicking, and anti-ban randomization.

Anti-AFK      : Simulates activity to prevent disconnection by pressing a user-defined key at set intervals. Smart AFK detection can pause activity when real input is detected.

Auto Run      : Holds down predefined movement keys to enable continuous running in-game without manual input.

Auto Eat      : Automatically presses assigned keys for food and water at user-set intervals to maintain in-game sustenance levels.

Auto ARB      : Automates repeated key holds to optimize specific game mechanics, such as rapid action sequences.

Join Sim      : Automates the game joining process using image recognition. Configurable options include waiting times, retry attempts, and confidence levels.

Keyboard Input	: Allows execution of custom key sequences at defined intervals. Users can configure key combinations, repeat settings, and window focus behavior for seamless automation.

Each of these features can be fully configured via the UI, allowing for easy adjustments of hotkeys, intervals, and activation modes.

Start & Stop Automation

The UI provides dedicated buttons to start and stop each automation feature.

Hotkeys can be assigned to toggle automation without needing to open the UI.

A universal stop-all hotkey can be configured to instantly disable all active features.

Features can run independently or simultaneously, depending on the userâ€™s preference.

Logging & Troubleshooting

All automation activities, errors, and key presses are recorded in autoclicker.log.

If an issue arises, users can reference the log file for error details and debugging.

The Discord community provides additional support, feature updates, and troubleshooting assistance.
